# Human-Activity-Recognition
Classify different physical activities from motion sensors data (accelerometers and gyroscope) colleted in smartphones and smartwatches by using a multilayer perceptron (implemented from scratch). 
Activities : ‘Biking’, ‘Sitting’, ‘Standing’, ‘Walking’, ‘Stair Up’ and ‘Stair down’.

Average_error% = 18% (k-fold cross-validation)

## Dataset
Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heterogeneity+Activity+Recognition

561 columns ; 
7352 lines

There two main files : one contains the data without classes and one contains classes only.


## Ackknowledgement
This personal project was intended as an exercise to understand the concept of Neural Network in Machine Learning. That is the reason why I chose to everything from scratch.
